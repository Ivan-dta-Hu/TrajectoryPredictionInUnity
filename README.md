I created an algorithm to simulate the trajectory of a rigid body with drag in Unity.
Additionally, I developed an algorithm to calculate the required initial velocity to reach a specified final position.
The equation derivations are provided in the attached PDF file.

The code is currently written in Python, so it can't be used directly in Unity. However, I may convert it to C# in the future.
